# Image Processing Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing various image processing techniques to analyze, enhance, and manipulate images. These techniques are widely used in applications such as computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

---

## Features
- **Image Loading and Display**: Load images in various formats and display them for visualization.
- **Filtering**: Apply filters such as Gaussian, Median, and Sobel to enhance image quality.
- **Edge Detection**: Identify and highlight edges in images using algorithms like Canny and Laplacian.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Improve image contrast for better visualization and analysis.
- **Thresholding**: Segment images using binary, adaptive, or Otsu's thresholding techniques.
- **Morphological Operations**: Perform dilation, erosion, opening, and closing for shape analysis.
- **Color Space Conversion**: Convert between RGB, Grayscale, HSV, and other color models.
- **Feature Detection**: Detect keypoints using methods like SIFT, SURF, or ORB.
- **Image Transformation**: Perform geometric transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:

1. **Python (>=3.8)**
2. **Libraries**:
   - OpenCV
   - NumPy
   - Matplotlib
   - Pillow

Install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pillow
```

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing-project.git
cd image-processing-project
```
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
Run the main script to execute the project:
```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to select the desired image processing technique. Alternatively, modify the script to automate specific tasks.

### Example Code Snippet
#### Edge Detection Example:
```python
import cv2

# Load image
gray_image = cv2.imread('example.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Apply Canny Edge Detection
edges = cv2.Canny(gray_image, 100, 200)

# Display results
cv2.imshow('Edges', edges)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
