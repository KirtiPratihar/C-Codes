OpenCV, short for Open Source Computer Vision Library, is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. Originally developed by Intel, it is now maintained by a community of developers under the OpenCV Foundation

## Features
Image Processing: Basic image transformations such as resizing, blurring, edge detection, and color manipulation.
Object Detection: Detect and classify objects using pre-trained models.
Face Detection: Implement face detection using Haar cascades or DNN models.
Video Processing: Process video streams with real-time filters and effects.
Custom Algorithms: Include custom algorithms for specific computer vision tasks.
